# Question App

This is a Question App built with React.js that provides an interactive quiz experience. Users can start the quiz, answer questions sequentially, and view their results at the end. The app utilizes custom hooks, the Context API for state management, and a ThemeContext to toggle between light and dark themes.

- **Timer for Each Question**: Each question has a 30-second timer. Answer options appear 10 seconds after the question is displayed.
- **Score Tracking**: Correct and incorrect answers are tracked, and the final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled to be responsive and user-friendly.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes using the theme button.
